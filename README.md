# LinearRegression_Model
This is my attempt at making a linear regression model. It basically predicts the final grade of a student by training on previous grades. It also plots graphs to view relation between the various attributes in the dataset. Feel free to mess with  the test size and x y labels of the plot.

I have used a for loop that runs the model 30 times to get the best line. It then saves the best line in a pickle file and then that can be used to predict for a new test. 
# Data Set Used
I used the student performance dataset available form the UCI Machine Learning Repository : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance
